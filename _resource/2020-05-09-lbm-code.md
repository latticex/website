title: Open Source Codes in LBM
---

## 1 Introduction

Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is different compare with *Continuum mechanics* method in macroscopic scale to describe fluid. LBM is based on *Statistical mechanics* in mesoscopic scale. LBM is a numerical method and belongs to *Computational Fluid Dynamics* (CFD). Compare with other numerical method, LBM is more like the *Finite Difference Method*.

In solving fluid dynamics, LBM is more easier to implement than solving the [Navier–Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier-Stokes_equations) directly through other methods, such as the *Finite Volume Method*. Currently popular open source code for LBM include **OpenLB**, **Palabos**, **waLBerla**, **Ludwig**, etc. I will introduce each of them in this post. If you know any other open source code in LBM, [contact](mailto:latticex@outlook.com) me and I will add it here.

## 2 Open Source Code

### 2.1 Palabos

#### 2.1.1 Overview

The Palabos library is a framework for general-purpose computational fluid dynamics (CFD), with a kernel based on the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. It is used both as a research and an engineering tool: its programming interface is straightforward and makes it possible to set up fluid flow simulations with relative ease, or, if you are knowledgeable of the lattice Boltzmann method, to extend the library with your own models. Palabos stands for Parallel Lattice Boltzmann Solver.

#### 2.1.2 Comments

Palabos is probably the most popular LBM based open source CFD code. Palabos is continuously updating in its source code [repository](https://gitlab.com/unigespc/palabos). Palabos seems a variety of complex models for particles, multi-phase flow, porous media etc. It also has off-lattice grid (need reference here) which should be very useful.

There are also extension libraries based on Palabos, such as the [Multiphase LBM Toolbox](https://github.com/je-santos/MultiphasePorousMediaPalabos).

### 2.2 OpenLB

#### 2.2.1 Overview

The OpenLB project provides a C++ package for the implementation of lattice Boltzmann methods that is general enough to address a vast range of transport problems, e.g. in computational fluid dynamics. The source code is publicly available and constructed in a well readable, modular way. This enables for a fast implementation of both simple academic test problems and advanced engineering applications. It is also easily extensible to include new physical content.

<highlight>You can access the official website and download the source code <a href="https://www.openlb.net/">here</a>.</highlight>

#### 2.2.2 Comments

OpenLB is a small scale source code compare with Palabos. It is said this code has better implemented turbulence model (need reference here). The newest release version of OpenLB was in September, 2019.

### 2.3 waLBerla

#### 2.3.1 Overview

waLBerla uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which is an alternative to classical Navier-Stokes solvers for computational fluid dynamics simulations. All of the common LBM collision models are implemented (SRT, TRT, MRT). Additionally, a coupling to the rigid body physics engine *pe* is available.

waLBerla is written in C++, which allows for modular and portable software design without having to make any performance tradeoffs.

#### 2.3.2 Comments

waLBerla seems a very mature and elegant code. waLBerla is continuously updating in its source code [repository](https://i10git.cs.fau.de/walberla/walberla). It has very good [tutorials](https://www.walberla.net/doxygen/index.html) for beginners, and there are a lot of high-quality [publications](https://www.walberla.net/publications.html) by the developers of waLBerla. I haven't looked through waLBerla, but definitely I will try to learn it.

### 2.4 Ludwig

#### 2.4.1 Overview

Ludwig is a parallel code for the simulation of complex fluids, which include mixtures, colloidal suspensions, gels, and liquid crystals. It takes its name from Ludwig Boltzmann. It typically combines hydrodynamics with a coarse-grained order parameter to represent the complex part in a free energy picture.

The Ludwig code has been developed largely at The University of Edinburgh over a number of years to address specific problems in complex fluids. The underlying hydrodynamic model is based on the lattice Boltzmann equation. This itself may be used to study simple (Newtonian) fluids in a number of different scenarios, including porous media and particle suspensions. However, the code is more generally suited to complex fluids, where a number of options are available, among others: symmetric binary fluids and, polar gels, liquid crystals, or charged fluid via a Poisson-Boltzmann equation approach. These features are added in the framework of a free energy approach, where specific compositional or orientational order parameters are evolved according to the appropriate coarse-grained dynamics, but also interact with the fluid in a fully coupled fashion.

The code is written in ANSI C, and can be used to perform serial and scalable parallel simulations of complex fluid systems based around hydrodynamics via the lattice Boltzmann method.

#### 2.4.2 Comments

This code is actually not easy to read, totally different point of view for the parallel LBM. I haven't looked through this code so this part is to be continued ...

### 2.5 Others

There must be other open source code based on LBM. One code I know is the AMROC code developed by [Dr. Ralf Deiterding](http://rdeiterding.website/). AMROC is actually not a stand along LBM code, it just contains a LBM solver. So this code can be used to peep the implementation structure integrate LBM to other CFD tools. You can access the source code of the LBM solver [here](http://rdeiterding.website/pub/AMROC/code/amroc/doc/html/lbm/files.html).

## 3 Discussions

As introduced in this article, there are several different LBM based open source CFD code, and each has its own advantages and focus. OpenLB or Palabos may be more suitable for beginners in LBM.

There are also LBM based commercial software for high fidelity CFD applications. The most popular ones are Simulia [PowerFLOW](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/powerflow/) and Simulia [XFlow](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/xflow/), all from Dassault Systèmes. Another commercial LBM software is [ProLB](http://www.prolb-cfd.com/). ProLB can perform high-fidelity aeroacoustic and aerodynamic simulations of weakly compressible flows thanks to its low dissipation and dispersion errors combined with state-of-the-art turbulence modeling approaches (Large Eddy Simulations).
