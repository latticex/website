Currently LatticeX initialized several projects, and we will gradually report our progress and release our achievements.

1. We are working on developing an open source code called [LatticeFlow](/code).
2. We are writing a free book called [LBM Theoretical Note](/book).
3. We are conducting research on the front edge of LBM.

Stay tuned!
