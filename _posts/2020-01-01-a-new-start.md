title: A New Start
---

This is the first day of the new year, 2020. From 2010-2020, I personally have achieved a lot of things, thus I believe 10-year is a time which long enough to achieve something big. Thus, I have a big hope for the comming new 10-year. I have been touching the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for a long time, but most of the times I just focused on the application of LBM istead of developing it. After graduation with a dectoral degree, I have an great opportinity to continue the study in the LBM area. This project is actually my part-time work, and I spent most of my afterhours in it. Here, I will periodically report the progress of the LatticeX project. And I hope anyone who are interested in CFD and LBM can join with me too.
