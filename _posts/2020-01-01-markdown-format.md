This is a divider:

This is a blockquote: 

> Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

Here are the method of using images:

<figure class="half">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/unsplash3.jpg' | absolute_url }}">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/unsplash2.jpg' | absolute_url }}">
    <figcaption>Caption describing these two images.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="third">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/unsplash3.jpg' | absolute_url }}">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/unsplash2.jpg' | absolute_url }}">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/unsplash1.jpg' | absolute_url }}">
    <figcaption>Caption describing these three images.</figcaption>
</figure>
---

Customize these values in the `_config.yml` file: 

```yml
title                    : "LatticeX"
title_separator          : "-"
description              : "Accelerate the Lattice Boltzmann Method"
favicon                  : "/assets/images/logo.png"
avatar                   : "/assets/images/logo.png"
```

For example the math equations $$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$ using MathJax. MathJax will now render simple LaTeX expressions correctly. Jekyll and MathJax do not offer all of the functionality of LaTeXâ€”there is no support for the LaTeX usepackage command, so only the core LaTeX functionality that has been ported to MathJax is available. This is why I use `boldsymbol` rather than `bm` above. For example, use `$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$` to write

$$
mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}
$$
